## Pregnancy First Trimester (Weeks 1-12)

### Common Symptoms
Morning sickness affects 70-80% of pregnant women, typically beginning around week 6 and improving by week 12-14. While called "morning sickness," nausea can occur at any time of day.

Management strategies:
- Eat small, frequent meals
- Keep crackers by your bedside
- Try ginger tea or ginger supplements
- Stay hydrated with small sips throughout the day
- Get adequate rest

**When to call your healthcare provider:**
- Severe vomiting preventing fluid intake
- Weight loss of more than 2 pounds
- Signs of dehydration (dizziness, dark urine, rapid heartbeat)

### Prenatal Vitamins
Folic acid is crucial during early pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects. The recommended dose is 400-800 mcg daily, ideally started before conception.

Key nutrients during pregnancy:
- Folic acid: 400-800 mcg daily
- Iron: 27 mg daily
- Calcium: 1000 mg daily
- DHA: 200-300 mg daily

## Breastfeeding Support

### Getting Started
Skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth helps establish breastfeeding. The first hour after birth is sometimes called the "golden hour" for initiating breastfeeding.

Signs of proper latch:
- Baby's mouth covers most of the areola
- You hear swallowing sounds
- Baby's chin touches your breast
- No persistent pain after initial discomfort

### Common Challenges
Engorgement typically occurs 2-5 days postpartum when milk supply increases. Management includes:
- Frequent feeding or pumping
- Warm compresses before feeding
- Cold compresses between feedings
- Gentle massage

**When to seek help:**
- Persistent pain during feeding
- Cracked or bleeding nipples
- Signs of mastitis (fever, red streaks, flu-like symptoms)
- Concerns about milk supply

## Newborn Care

### Sleep Safety
Follow the ABCs of safe sleep:
- **Alone**: Babies should sleep alone in their own sleep space
- **Back**: Always place babies on their backs to sleep
- **Crib**: Use a firm sleep surface in a safety-approved crib

Room-sharing without bed-sharing is recommended for at least the first 6 months.

### Feeding Cues
Early hunger cues (easier to feed when baby shows these):
- Stirring and stretching
- Rooting (turning head and opening mouth)
- Bringing hands to mouth

Late hunger cues (baby may be harder to latch):
- Fussing and crying
- Moving head frantically
- Clenched fists
